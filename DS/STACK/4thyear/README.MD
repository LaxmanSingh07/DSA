## STACK

stack is the data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

- It is a linear data structure that follows the order of insertion and deletion.
- The insertion and deletion operations are performed at the same end, which is called the top of the stack.
- The top of the stack is the only place where the insertion and deletion operations are performed.
- The stack is used in many applications, such as expression evaluation, function call management, and backtracking. The stack is implemented using arrays and linked lists. The stack implemented using arrays is called an array stack, and the stack implemented using linked lists is called a linked stack.

### Operations on Stack

The following operations are performed on the stack:

- **Push**: The push operation is used to insert an element into the stack. The push operation is performed at the top of the stack.

- **Pop**: The pop operation is used to delete an element from the stack. The pop operation is performed at the top of the stack.

- **Peek or Top**: The peek operation is used to retrieve the top element of the stack without deleting it.

- **isEmpty**: The isEmpty operation is used to check whether the stack is empty or not.

- **isFull**: The isFull operation is used to check whether the stack is full or not.

### Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

- It is a linear data structure that follows the order of insertion and deletion.

- The insertion operation is performed at the rear end, and the deletion operation is performed at the front end.

- The queue is used in many applications, such as CPU scheduling, disk scheduling, and network routing.

- The queue is implemented using arrays and linked lists. The queue implemented using arrays is called an array queue, and the queue implemented using linked lists is called a linked queue.

### Operations on Queue

The following operations are performed on the queue:

- **Enqueue**: The enqueue operation is used to insert an element into the queue. The enqueue operation is performed at the rear end of the queue.

- **Dequeue**: The dequeue operation is used to delete an element from the queue. The dequeue operation is performed at the front end of the queue.

- **Front**: The front operation is used to retrieve the front element of the queue without deleting it.

- **Rear**: The rear operation is used to retrieve the rear element of the queue without deleting it.

- **isEmpty**: The isEmpty operation is used to check whether the queue is empty or not.

- **isFull**: The isFull operation is used to check whether the queue is full or not.
