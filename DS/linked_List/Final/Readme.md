## LINKED LIST:  

Collections of Node

Structure of the NODE:

| Data | Address |

Data can be of any datatype
Address of the next node


DS : Non-linear memory DataStructure
In Linked List a shell is Represented by a Node

Array vs Linked List:

- Here are the some of the differences between Array and Linked List.

- Array is a collection of elements of similar data type whereas the Linked List is a collection of nodes wherein each node has a data part and an address part.
- Array elements can be accessed randomly using the array index whereas the Linked List can be accessed sequentially starting from the first node.
- The size of the arrays is fixed whereas the Linked list size is not fixed, it can grow or shrink depending on the requirement.
- Inserting and deleting an element in an array is expensive, whereas the insertion and deletion operation in Linked list are much faster.
- In an array, memory is assigned during compile time while in a Linked list it is allocated during execution or runtime.

## Types of Linked List:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
            - Singly Circular Linked List
            - Doubly Circular Linked List
