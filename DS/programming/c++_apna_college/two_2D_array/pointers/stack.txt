stack overflow in recursion 
bcz size of the stack is fixed 

heap (free store )4

size is not fixed 
// new operator is allocate memory in heap 
// we should deallocate memoy in case of the dynamic memory location 

.. dangling pointer is the pointer which is pointing to that address where is no value is present
