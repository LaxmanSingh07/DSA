//Hashing 
Hashing is mainy use to impleent dictonary where we have key value pairs it is also use in case of set 



it prvoide search insert and delete o(1) on averge 

in hash table or hasing we always have a unique value no duplicates allowed 

// you inserent all the keys in an array
 if unordered fashion
 search o(n);
 if sorted fashion
 search o(logn);

 /// unordered
 insert delete --o(1);



 /// binary search tree AVL AND RED BLACK tree ------> they take big O(logn ) time for search insert and delete ;
 but it is still more than 0(1)



 hence hashing beats arrays,avl and red black trees 
 in term = search, insert and delete 


// Hashing IS NOT USEFUL for
LIKE EXAMPLES-------
 FINDING CLOSESST VALUE 
 SORTED DATA

 WE USE AVL AND RED BLACK TREE
