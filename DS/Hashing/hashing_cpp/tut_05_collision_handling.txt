it we know keys in advance, then we can perfect Hashing
if we don't know keys then we use one of the following
    1. chaining ----> we make cahin of the collide item
    2. Open Addressing  
            2.1 liner probling 
            2.2 Quadratic Probing 
            2.3 Double hashing 


Birthday Paradox 

// if you don't know the key in advance then collision is bound to happen
