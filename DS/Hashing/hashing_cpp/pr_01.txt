//Hashing is mainly used to implement the Hashing where you have the key value pairs 
it is also used to implement set 



//the main thing of the hasing is that it provide search,insert and delete all three operation int O(n) time complexity 
// in hash table we always has the unique value 
not duplicate is allowed 


it a key is already exist and you will try to insert the another key then it will get overwrite 


delete ----> deleting the key 

all the known data structure is beaten by the Hashing when you consider these three operations 

//Array 

-----> search --->liner time ---> unsorted 
-------> sorted ----> then O(log)

//binary search tree 

-----> O(logn)


//---------> Hashing is used for  strict search 

//-------> It is only used for Search ,insert delete

Not useful for: 

---> finding closest value ----avl or red black tree
---> sorted data--------------avl or red black tre
---> prefix searching  ------> Trie data structure





//Hash Table is mostly used(after array ) DS in the computer science 

Application OF Hashing

1. Dictionaries 
2. Database Indexing ----> either used b/b+ tree OR hASINGH
3. Crytography -----> to store the hash 
4. Caches ---> ex. browser Caches ..... url is key and data becomes value 
5. Symbol Table in Compliers/Interpreters ...... to find out there address
6. routers ----> connected to local devices ---> and internet also 
7. getting data from dataBases 
 8. many more
