    Due to the cluster all your operation become costly 
    search,insert and delete

linear probing
hash(key,i)=(h(key)+l)%7
hash(key)=key%7;

    How to handle these problem


    1. Quadratic probing
      (i)- hash(key,i)=(h(key)+l^2)%m)

       1. in the Quadratic there is a problem of secondary cluster
        secondary cluster is better then primary Clustering
       2. But Quadratic probing has a more disadvantage compare to linear probing
            it might not find the empty slots even there are empty SLOTS
        
        load factor<0.5
        alpha=n/m
        m is a prime factor
        then it will gurantee you that it will find an empty slot
        if you Double the size of hash table as compare to the keys that you are insearting to the hash table 



    2. Double hashing
        hash(key,i)=(h1(key)+i*h2(key))%m
