chaining                                       Open chaining
1. Hash Table never fills                   Table may become full and resizing becomes mandatory
2. less sensitive to hash function         Extra care required for Clustering 
3. poor cache performance                  cache FRIENDLLY
4. extra space for links   (1+alpha)        extra space might be needed to achieve same performance as chaining
                                            1/1-alpha
                                            no of keys know in advance (perfect hashing)

but when we want more and more keys to inserted dynamically then you can use the chaining
