//DIRECT ADDRESS TABLE 

Imagine a situation where you have 1000 keys with value from ( 0 to 999), how would you implement following in O(1) time 

1. search 
2. insert
3. delete


EXAMPLE operation

insert(10)
insert(20)
insert( 119)
search(10)
search(20)---> 
search(119)
delete(119)



we can also use if we know the range of the input 
// DIRECT addres table is used for smaller value or small range value 

problem ----> it can't handle the large key
and another is floating point no(index is always int ) 
your keys can be String and address
